# SmartFace Library

SmartFace is a Python library for real-time face emotion analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the AffectNet dataset. It detects faces in images and video streams using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier and predicts emotions using a pre-trained deep learning model.

## Features
- Detects faces in images and videos
- Predicts emotions such as Angry, Happy, Sad, Neutral, etc.
- Draws bounding boxes and labels emotions on detected faces
- Supports real-time emotion detection via webcam
