# SmartFace
SmartFace is a Python library for real-time face emotion analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the AffectNet dataset. It detects faces in images and video streams using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier and predicts emotions using a pre-trained deep learning model.
